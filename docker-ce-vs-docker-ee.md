# Docker CE vs Docker EE

### Docker CE：[Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

Docker Community Edition \(CE\) is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

### Docker EE：[Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition)

Docker Enterprise Edition \(EE\) 2.0 is the only enterprise-ready container platform that enables IT leaders to choose how to cost-effectively build and manage their entire application portfolio at their own pace, without fear of architecture and infrastructure lock-in.
